# K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification Project

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification Project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the KNN algorithm using the popular Iris dataset.

## Overview

The K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms used for classification tasks. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. This project applies the KNN algorithm to classify iris flowers into three different species based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


## Dataset

The `Iris.csv` file contains the famous Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

These features are used to predict the species of an iris flower.

## Implementation

The `K_nearest_neigubour.ipynb` notebook walks through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Implementing the KNN algorithm and training it on the Iris dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Testing the model's performance and evaluating its accuracy.
4. **Visualization:** Plotting the results to visualize the model's predictions.

## Usage

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/KNN-Iris-Classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd KNN-Iris-Classification
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `K_nearest_neigubour.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Results

The KNN algorithm successfully classifies the iris flowers with high accuracy. The visualization section in the notebook provides detailed plots that help in understanding the model's performance.
